These audio files are used by the Ambisonics plugins. The /audio360 contents are first-order (FOA) and third-order (TOA) recordings done with ambisonic microphones. The /filters contents are filter example files that can be used by the ambisonic decoding module to convert ambisonic audio to headphone (binaural) audio. These are created from IRCAM’s LISTEN HRTF set. The HOA1_IRC_1008_virtual.wav should be used for the FOA decoder plugin, while the HOA3_IRC_1008_virtual_01-08ch.wav & HOA3_IRC_1008_virtual_09-16ch.wav should be used with the TOA decoder plugin, after they have been merged into one audio buffer, using the ambisonic buffer merger plugin.
